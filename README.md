<p>The game was in active development for about 3 months, after which it was finalized for another 4 months, in 2020.</p>
<p>He was developed to the order of a teacher in college during the second year.</p>
<p>The main target was to create a GUI interface similar to Valve's GUI, but superior to it in terms of FPS performance, due to the frame update technology only on events. This GUI can be called the game engine, as some of its code is the basis for the game. In addition to all this, it is worth noting the work with UTF binary encoding in game files: an exporter of pictures, music, video, text in Russian into one file. It is also possible to connect an arduino "receiver" on the radio control to play with buttons that will help teams identify who should answer first.<p>
